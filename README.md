# Streamline Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project is a 3D streamline visualization tool for exploring vector and tensor fields, with a focus on brain imaging and scientific visualization. The application allows interactive exploration of complex vector fields through streamline generation, rendering, and advanced visualization techniques.


### Streamline Parameter Sliders


### Camera Navigation


### Interactivity

#### Mouse seeding


## Visualization Techniques

## Dependencies
- OpenGL
- GLFW3
- GLM
- GLAD (included in repo)
- Eigen (included in repo)
- ImGui (included in repo)

## Build Instructions
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Use CMake to compile and run the code

## Potential Improvements
- Add more advanced filtering techniques
- Implement tensor field visualization
- Optimize performance for large datasets so that parameters can be adjusted in real time
